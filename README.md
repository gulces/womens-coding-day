# Women's Coding Day Landing Page

This landing page was created for the "Women's Coding Day" workshop at Le Wagon London, where we went over the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, guiding participants to build a basic landing page within an hour. This project represents a great opportunity for hands-on learning and showcases the power of coding, illustrating how accessible it can be.<br>

## Running the Project Locally

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- A code editor (e.g., [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (if not already installed)
<br>

### Clone the Repository

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/gulces/womens-coding-day-landing-page.git
```
<br>

### Local Server (Using `http-server`)

You can easily set up a basic HTTP server using [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server). If you don't have `http-server` installed, you can install it globally with the following command:
<br>
```
npm install -g http-server
```
<br>
Once you have http-server installed, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command to start a local web server:
<br>
<br>

```
http-server
```
<br>
This will start a local web server, and you can access the landing page in your browser at localhost:8080. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, please refer to the "Contact" section below.
